Given the following list:
    [ 1, 4, 7, 3, 5, 2, 8, 6 ]

We start by splitting the list in halve, to the point we are left with lists of length 1.
I.e.:
    [ 1, 4,     7, 3,     5, 2,     8, 6 ]

    [ 1, 4 ], [ 7, 3 ], [ 5, 2 ], [ 8, 6 ]

    [1], [4], [7], [3], [5], [2], [8], [6]

We have now hit our base case.
Now we recurse back over the lists,
